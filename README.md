# Profanity PHP

Selfishly made for my own use. Open Sourcing it to recieve - `what an ugly code!` compliment every once in a while.

Has some cool functions though.

Uses [List of Dirty, Naughty, Obscene, and Otherwise Bad Words](https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words.git)

Take a look around the code and try to figure out what it does LOL.

Have a NOICE day!
