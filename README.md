Welcome to Profanity PHP, the vibrant library designed to keep your text sparkling clean! üåü This lightweight and efficient tool is your go-to solution for detecting profanity in text using a comprehensive list of naughty words from [List of Dirty, Naughty, Obscene, and Otherwise Bad Words](https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words.git).

## Features üåà

1. Detect profane words in a string using a comprehensive list of profane words as a Hash Table.
2. Uncover naughty phrases in a string using a comprehensive list of profane phrases. This uses the Boyer-Moore algorithm to find phrases, treating each word as a character.

## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will help you set up the library in your project.

### Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

Ensure you have the following installed:

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- Git

### Installation üöö

1. Clone the repository or add it as a submodule to your project.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/friendshipking/profanity_php.git
   # OR
   git submodule add https://github.com/friendshipking/profanity_php.git
   ```

2. Follow these instructions if there is a new commit in the [List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words_V2](https://github.com/LDNOOBWV2/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words_V2.git):

   - Run the [step_1.php](https://github.com/friendshipking/profanity_php/blob/main/build/step_1.php) to create the `languages` directory and files.
   - Run the [step_2.php](https://github.com/friendshipking/profanity_php/blob/main/build/step_2.php) to create the `countryToSupportedLanguageCodes` array.
   - Run the [step_3.php](https://github.com/friendshipking/profanity_php/blob/main/build/step_3.php) to list all the three-letter codes that are not added to the `countryToSupportedLanguageCodes` array. If there is no output, you are good to go. Otherwise:
   - Use the AI prompt inside [three_letter_codes.php](https://github.com/friendshipking/profanity_php/blob/main/build/three_letter_codes.php) file to generate the array. Replace the existing array in the file. If Bing is unable to get the language, use this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) to get the language code. After adding the array, run [step_2.php](https://github.com/friendshipking/profanity_php/blob/main/build/step_2.php) again.
   - All required files are successfully generated.
   - Test the setup by running the [test.php](https://github.com/friendshipking/profanity_php/blob/main/test.php) file.
   - Commit the changes and create a pull request to the main repo. This ensures that the library is up to date with the latest changes in [List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words_V2](https://github.com/LDNOOBWV2/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words_V2.git).

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

- `$exploded`: The exploded and cleaned string to remove punctuations and emojis. Optional. If you are already creating an exploded string, pass it to the function to avoid creating it again. If not provided, then $text must be provided.
- `$explodedLength`: The length of the exploded string. Optional. Must be provided if $exploded is provided.
- `$all`: If true, check for all available languages. Optional. When set, all the languages are checked for profanity. If false, only the languages in `$detectedLanguages` or auto-detected languages are checked.
